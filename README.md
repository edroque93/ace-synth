# MIPS - ACEsynth

"[Fork]" of a MIPS Processor developed during the course of [Processor Architecture] 2015 at UPC. Our goal is to make all the changes needed to synthesize our processor and make it work outside a simulator.

This project is part of the course [Processor Design] 2016 at UPC.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Check and plan better the roadmap
- [ ] General clean up (unused features, dirty tricks)
- [ ] Fight against the ip compiler -> adjustments
- [ ] Be able to synthesize a first version
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Testbenchs
